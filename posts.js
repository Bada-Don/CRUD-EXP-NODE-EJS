        para: "Quantum computers are a new type of computer that use the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems that are too complex for classical computers. Quantum mechanics is the study of how matter behaves at the atomic and subatomic level. At this level, matter behaves in ways that are very different from how it behaves at the macroscopic level. One of the key principles of quantum mechanics is superposition. Superposition means that a quantum particle can be in multiple states at the same time. For example, an electron can be in a state where it is both spinning up and spinning down at the same time.",
